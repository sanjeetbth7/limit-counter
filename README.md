# LimitCounter

**LimitCounter** is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to increment or decrement a counter value within a specified range. The counter is bounded between 0 and 150, and the app features a dynamic progress bar that visually represents the current count. It also includes an undo/redo functionality, ensuring that users can easily reverse or reapply their last actions.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement Counter**: Two buttons to add or subtract from the counter value, with enforced limits (0 ≤ count ≤ 150).
- **Progress Bar**: A visually appealing progress bar that updates dynamically based on the current count.
- **Undo/Redo**: Easily undo or redo the last action to adjust the counter state.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated transitions for the progress bar to enhance the user experience.

- **Undo/Redo**: Use the Undo and Redo buttons to reverse or reapply your last action.
- **Progress Bar**: Watch the progress bar dynamically update as the count changes.
